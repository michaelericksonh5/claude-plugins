description: STEP 7 (optional) — Adapt an existing UI mock to a new theme/palette while preserving exact layout (button positions, panel proportions, control placement). Edit operation, not from-scratch generation. Use when reusing a proven UI layout across reskinned games or matching a partner's reference UI. Anchored to the locked key art so the new theme stays consistent. Use when the user says "reskin the UI", "adapt the existing layout to the new theme", "apply the new look to this UI", "take this reference UI and make it match our game", or "keep the same layout but change the theme".

# Step 7 — UI Reskin (optional)

Reskins an existing UI mock — same layout, new theme. Required when reusing
a proven UI from another game or adapting a partner's reference UI.

For from-scratch UI design, use `/slot-step-06` instead.

## Startup protocol

Follow `shared/project_memory.md` → "Skill startup protocol", including
the "no active project — guide through setup" pattern.

1. Resolve active project. **If none exists**, route to `/slot-step-01`
   → `/slot-step-02` → resume the reskin here in the same conversation.
2. Load `project.json`, `game_brief.json`.
3. Read `style_anchor.key_art_path` — the new theme's visual anchor.
   **If not locked**, route to `/slot-step-02` first; the new theme
   needs an anchor to reskin against.
4. **Required source image**: the UI mock to reskin. User provides the
   path. Without a source image, this skill has nothing to operate on —
   ask the user to attach or path-to one before continuing. (This is
   distinct from the prerequisite-chain pattern above; it's a per-call
   input the user controls, not a project setup state.)

### If the user pastes / attaches the UI mock in chat

Chat-attached images live in temp paths outside the allowed-roots envelope —
`nb2_edit` will reject them. **Stage first**, then use the staged path:

```
nb2_stage_image({ source: "<chat-temp-path>", label: "ui_reskin_source" })
  → ~/.h5g-slot-art-creator/inputs/ui_reskin_source_NNN.png
```

Pass that staged path as `source` to `nb2_edit` in Step 4. See
`shared/chat_image_staging.md` for full details on when staging is required.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Identify source and target

- **Source image**: the existing UI mock to reskin (path provided by user
  or pulled from another approved asset like `Bezel_001.png` from a prior project)
- **Target theme**: the locked brief's style + palette

### Step 2 — Build the reskin prompt

Read the full 5-part bracketed-block prompt template in `RESKIN_TEMPLATE.md`
(short — about 30 lines including the substitution guide). The structure
locks layout preservation in part 1 and confines surface changes to part 2,
which is the structural discipline NB2 needs to actually preserve positions
when reskinning.

Fill the template's placeholders from the brief's `theme_summary`,
`palette_leads`, and `style_lock`.

### Step 3 — Pre-generation validation (Gate 1)

- [ ] Source image path provided and exists
- [ ] `style_lock` and palette from brief in the surface-changes block
- [ ] Both "preserve exactly" and "surface changes only" blocks present
- [ ] No hex / resolution / aspect ratio strings in prompt body

### Step 4 — Generate (edit operation)

**Pick the right tool first.** Text-heavy source UIs (paytables, logos,
HUDs with baked button labels, partner reference UIs full of copy)
preserve their wording more reliably with gpt-image-2; everything else
preserves layout better with NB2. Decision rule:

| Source UI has visible required text? | `OPENAI_API_KEY` set? | Use this tool |
|---|---|---|
| yes (labels, wordmarks, pay values) | yes | `mcp__nb2node__gpt2_edit` |
| yes | no | `mcp__nb2node__nb2_edit` (be ready for 2–4 attempts to keep text legible; verify every label at the QA gate) |
| no (pure chrome — bezel, panel, decorative banner) | either | `mcp__nb2node__nb2_edit` |

See `shared/gpt_image2_prompting.md` — its routing table lists this
skill explicitly. Both tools take the source UI mock in the same
`source` arg, and both take `extra_references` as an **array of
absolute paths** (server schema: `array<string>`). The typical usage
here is a single-element array carrying the locked key art as a style
anchor; pass `[<absolute key art path>]` to either tool. The
difference is compositional behavior: `gpt2_edit` composes the
`source` plus every entry in `extra_references` into the output,
while `nb2_edit` treats the array as style references only.

**API args (NB2 path — pure chrome reskins):**

| API arg | Value |
|---|---|
| `prompt` | composed reskin prompt |
| `source` | absolute path to the source UI mock — resolve any relative filenames against `project_root` first (`path.join(project_root, stored_relative_path)`) |
| `aspect_ratio` | match the source image's ratio (omit to inherit, or pass explicitly) |
| `image_size` | `"2K"` minimum |
| `output_dir` | **the source's category folder** — `path.join(project_root, "<SourceFolder>")`. Look at the source path: if it lives in `Bezels/`, the reskin lands in `Bezels/`; if it lives in `HUD/`, the reskin lands in `HUD/`. This keeps each surface's iterations together regardless of whether they came from generate or reskin. |
| `asset_name` | `"<SurfaceLabel>_reskin"`, e.g. `"Bezel_reskin"`, `"HUD_reskin"`, `"Paytable_reskin"`. The MCP server appends `_NNN.png` and auto-increments by scanning the target folder for files with that prefix. |
| `extra_references` | absolute path — resolve `style_anchor.key_art_path` against `project_root`, then pass `[<absolute>]` to lock the new theme. |

**API args (gpt2 path — text-heavy source UIs):**

| API arg | Value |
|---|---|
| `prompt` | same composed reskin prompt; gpt-image-2 honours the layout-preservation discipline when the source UI mock is passed as `source` (primary input) and the key art rides along as a style reference |
| `source` | absolute path to the source UI mock — same as the NB2 path. This is the **primary input** the edit operates on. Resolve any relative filename against `project_root` first; stage chat-attached paths via `nb2_stage_image` before passing them here. |
| `extra_references` | `[<absolute key art path>]` — gpt-image-2 composes the `source` plus every entry in `extra_references` together, so use this slot for **style anchors only** (the locked key art is the typical entry). Don't put the source UI mock here too — it goes in `source`. |
| `aspect_ratio` | match source |
| `image_size` | `"2K"` (the stable production ceiling) |
| `quality` | `"high"` |
| `output_dir` | same per-surface routing as the NB2 path — the source's category folder |
| `asset_name` | same convention as NB2 |

### Step 5 — Inline QA check — 8-axis layout-preservation rubric

Read the output. Compare against source:

| Axis | PASS | FAIL action |
|---|---|---|
| Control count | Same number of buttons/panels/labels | Add: "Do NOT add any control not visible in source image" |
| Control positions | Each control in roughly same x/y | Add: "preserve every control's pixel position relative to the canvas" |
| Control proportions | Same relative sizes | Add: "preserve the exact aspect-ratio of every individual button and panel" |
| Typographic hierarchy | Same text largest/smallest | Restate hierarchy explicitly |
| Spacing/padding | Same gaps | Add: "preserve all gaps and padding" |
| Theme application | Uniform new palette + decoration | Restate theme bullet in BOTH preservation AND surface-changes |
| Material consistency | Chrome reads as one set | Restate material treatment uniformly |
| Decorative motifs | Same positions as old ones | Add: "place decorative motifs in same positions as source" |

Any FAIL → patch prompt and regenerate (max 2 retries).

### Step 6 — Update state

Append an iteration record to `project.json.assets.ui.<surface>.iterations`
per `shared/project_memory.md` → "Writing an iteration record
(checklist for skills)". Reskin-specifics (this skill is edit-based,
not fresh-generate, so the discipline differs from the other gen
skills):
- `path` = e.g. `"Bezels/Bezel_reskin_001.png"` — the reskin lands in
  the source's category folder, not a separate "reskins" folder.
- `prompt` = the rendered 5-part reskin prompt sent to the MCP tool.
- `references` = `[<absolute key art path resolved to relative form>]`
  for the style anchor passed in `extra_references`. The source UI
  mock does NOT go in references — it goes in `parent_path`.
- `parent_path` = the **source UI mock's path** (relative-with-subfolder
  if the source was a project asset, or the staged input path if it
  was a chat-attached image). Critical for this skill: the reskin's
  lineage is the source, not a fresh generate.
- `model` = either `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` / `fal-ai/nano-banana-2/edit`
  (NB2 path) or `gpt-image-2` (gpt2 path), as reported in the response.
- `attempt_index` increments for retries within the same source.

If user approves, set `project.json.assets.ui.<surface>.approved` to
the approved iteration's `path`. The reskin iteration lands in the
same `assets.ui.<surface>` slot as a from-scratch generation — reskin
is just another way to produce a bezel/hud/paytable, not a separate
asset type.

Set `current_step: "reskin_complete"`, `next_step: "/slot-step-08"`.
Atomic-write `project.json`.

Schema follows the canonical asset record shape in
`shared/project_memory.md`.

### Step 7 — Next step nudge

```
✓ Step 7 — UI Reskin complete.
  Source : <source relative path, e.g. Bezels/Bezel_001.png>
  Output : <output relative path, e.g. Bezels/Bezel_reskin_001.png>
  Layout preserved across all 8 axes ✓
  Folder: <project_root>/<SourceFolder>/
  Open:   file:///<project_root>/<SourceFolder>/

Next: run `/slot-step-08` for the final cross-asset audit
or continue with more reskins.

Type `/slot-` to see the full numbered workflow.
```

## Hard rules

- **Source image required.** Skill does nothing without one.
- **Single source image only.**
- **Never change copy.** Don't rewrite button labels.
- **Match source aspect ratio** unless user explicitly requests reformat
  (passed via API arg, not prompt body).
